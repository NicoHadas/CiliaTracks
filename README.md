# CiliaTracks

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/CiliaTracks.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/CiliaTracks)
[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/CiliaTracks.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/CiliaTracks)

A set of computational tools for the visualization and quantitative analysis of cilia-driven particle movement, designed to process TrackMate data from high-speed video microscopy of cultured airway cells.

This package provides the functions to analyze and visualize data from TrackMate exports, complementing the research detailed in our publication on Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD).

### Core Capabilities

* **Trajectory Visualization:** Generate high-quality angular plots that visualize particle trajectory, displacement, and speed.

* **Feature Engineering for Classification:** Automatically extract a comprehensive feature set from track data for input into our XGBoost model for classifying PCD and healthy samples. The feature set could also be used to train and develop new machine learning classifiers. 

* **Standardized Image Generation for CNNs:** Produce normalized trajectory images suitable as direct input for our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

### Installation

There are two ways to install `CiliaTracks`:

**Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)**

The easiest way to install the package is from the Python Package Index (PyPI). This will provide the latest stable release.

```bash
pip install CiliaTracks
```

**Option 2: Install from GitHub**

To get the latest development version, you can install the package directly from this GitHub repository.

```bash
pip install git+[https://github.com/NicoHadas/CiliaTracks.git](https://github.com/NicoHadas/CiliaTracks.git)
```

### Quick Start

The following example demonstrates how to generate and display a trajectory plot from TrackMate CSV files.

```python
import CiliaTracks as CT
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define paths to your TrackMate CSV files
tracks_file = 'path/to/your/Tracks.csv'
spots_file = 'path/to/your/Spots.csv'

# Optional: Define a pixel-to-micrometer conversion factor
conversion_factor = 0.65 # e.g., 1 pixel = 0.65 Âµm

# Generate the trajectory plot figure
fig = CT.trajectory(
    Tracks=tracks_file, 
    Spots=spots_file, 
    Conversion=conversion_factor
)

# Display the plot interactively
plt.show()

# To save the figure
# fig.savefig('trajectory_plot.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```
